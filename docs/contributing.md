# Contributing 

All contributions are welcomed, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project! 
These are a set of guidelines for contributing to the development of Slips [1].

## How can you contribute?

* Run Slips and report bugs and needed features, and suggest ideas
* Pull requests with a solved GitHub issue and new feature
* Pull request with a new detection module.

## Persistent Git Branches

The following git branches in the Slips repository are permanent:

- `master`: contains the stable version of Slips, with new versions at least once a month.
- `develop`: contains the latest unstable version of Slips and also its latest features. All new features should be based on this branch.

## Naming Git branches for Pull Requests

To keep the Git history clean and facilitate the revision of contributions we 
ask all branches to follow concise namings. These are the branch-naming patterns
to follow when contributing to Slips:

- author-bugfix-:        pull request branch, contains one bugfix,
- author-docs-:          pull request branch, contains documentation work,
- author-enhance-:       pull request branch, contains one enhancement (not a new feature, but improvement nonetheless)
- author-feature-:       pull request branch, contains a new feature,
- author-refactor-:      pull request branch, contains code refactoring,

## What branch should you base your contribution to Slips?

As a general rule, base your contributions to the `develop` branch.

## Creating a pull request

Commits:
- Commits should follow the KISS principle: do one thing, and do it well (keep it simple, stupid).
- Commit messages should be easily readable, imperative style ("Fix memory leak in...", not "FixES mem...")

Pull Requests:
- If you have developed multiple features and/or bugfixes, create separate
    branches for each one of them, and request merges for each branch;
- Each PR to develop will trigger the develop Github checks, these checks will run Slips unit tests and integration tests locally in a ubuntu VM and in docker to make sure the branch is ready to merge.
- PRs won't be merged unless the checks pass.
- The cleaner you code/change/changeset is, the faster it will be merged.

## Beginner tips on how to create a PR in Slips

Here's a very simple beginner-level steps on how to create your PR in Slips

1. Clone the Slips repo 
2. In your clone, checkout origin/develop: ```git checkout origin develop```
3. Create your own branch off develop using your name and the feature name:  ```git checkout -b <yourname>_<feature_name> develop```
4. Change the code, add the feature or fix the bug, etc. then commit with a descriptive msg ```git commit -m "descriptive msg here" ```
5. Test your code: this is a very important step. you shouldn't open a PR with code that is not working: ```./tests/run_all_tests.sh```
6. If some tests didn't pass, it means you need to fix something in your branch. 
7. Push to your own repo: ```git push -u origin <yourname>_<feature_name>``` 
8. Open a PR in Slips, remember to set the base branch as develop.
9. List your changes in the PR description

Some IDEs like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/work-with-github-pull-requests.html) and [vscode](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github-using-vs-code-f03db28308c4) have the option 
to open a PR from within the IDE. 

That's it, now you have a ready-to-merge PR!
